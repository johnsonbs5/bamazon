In this activity, we are creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

We created both 2 JS files for both the Customer and the Manager as well!

Try out our code for yourself or take a look at the images folder to see screenshots of the process.
